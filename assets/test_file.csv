18/02/2025,2,F203,11 Biology,Pluto,Pluto,Modelling kidney filtration and dialysis,"If I cannot get 12 groups, I will just take what I can get - thanks","Pre-cut the dialysis tubing into 15 cm lengths and soak for 15 minutes in a beaker filled with
room-temperature distilled water.
For the 2% starch solution, dissolve 2 g of starch in 100 mL of boiling hot water on a hot
plate until the powder has fully dissolved. Stir gently.
For the 30% glucose solution, dissolve 30 g of glucose in 100 mL of water; stir until the
glucose has been fully dissolved.
For the student solution, combine the starch and glucose solutions. Mix well.

1. With a 50 mL measuring cylinder, measure 10 mL of the glucose/starch solution. Pour into a small
beaker.
2. Create a dilute solution of starch/glucose to identify the initial concentration. With the pipette
labelled 'S', measure 1 mL of solution and add to 9 mL of distilled water in a second small beaker.
Stir gently.
3. Dip a glucose testing strip in the solution and place on a white tile. After one minute, observe any
colour change and record the corresponding pH from the glucose strip colour guide. Record your
results.
4. Fill a 250 mL beaker with 100 mL of distilled water and add 1 mL of the iodine/potassium iodine
solution with the pipette labelled 'I'.
5. Dip a glucose testing strip into the solution and place on a white tile. After one minute, observe any
colour change and record the corresponding pH from the glucose strip colour guide. Record your
results.
6. Secure one end of the dialysis tubing with a rubber band.
7. Insert a funnel into the open end of the tubing, and carefully pour the starch/glucose solution until the
tube is approximately half-full. Using slightly wet fingers and rubbing the top of the tubing can assist
with separating the layers.
8. Secure the open end with a rubber band. Wash the outside of the tube with distilled water.
9. Place a beaker on an electronic balance and press 'Tare'. Place the tubing into the beaker and record
the mass.
10. Submerge the dialysis tubing into the iodine solution for 15 minutes. Record any colour changes.
11. Dip a glucose testing strip into the solution and place on a white tile. After 1 minute, observe any
colour change and record the corresponding pH from the glucose strip colour guide. Record your
results.
12. Remove the tubing from the beaker and pat dry with paper towel.
13. Carefully remove the rubber band from one end of the tubing, pouring the contents into an empty
beaker.
14. With the pipette labelled 'E', measure 1 mL of solution and add to 9 mL of distilled water in a small
beaker. Stir gently.
15. Dip a glucose testing trip in the solution and place on a white tile. After 1 minute, observe any colour
change and record the corresponding pH from the glucose strip colour guide. Record your results.",12,"12 x groups:
